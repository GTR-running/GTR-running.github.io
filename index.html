                We're also an incorporated not-for-profit entity,
                enabling us to steer the growth of both the
                permanent and visiting trail running community

                We educate and foster the connection
                to the surrounding environment and
                appreciation for the cultural significance
                of the area.
                We increase community connection,
                while positively influencing mental and
                physical health.
                We connect visiting and local trail
                runners, encouraging destination trail
                running trips outside of peak periods.

            <h3>we run</h3>
            <div class="subtitle">                
                Friday morning is our regular weekly run, usually meeting in Halls Gap or
                nearby. The Friday run is for everyone, regardless of pace or trail experience. 
                stay tuned to the socials for the start time & location, then it's as simple as 
                turning up!
                On the weekends we may venture further afield. Our specials board may 
                require an intermediate or advanced trail background. To join a run on the 
                specials board, send a DM ahead of time and we'll work out logistics.
                Want to check out the trails by yourself?
                We can point you in the right direction. Check our feed to see a whole bunch 
                of runs from entry-level to super-challenging! Enjoy, be safe, and please look 
                after the amazing running trails in Gariwerd.
